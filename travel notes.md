a area map with spots are created
the traveller taps on spots they want guides for and are given 


swipe left if you don't want to visit, swipe right if you want to go. (tinder for tourism)


# storytelling from tourist spots
# -------------------------------
do you wish someone was able to share their special moments in places when you travel?
	sure, you can pay for travel guides, but you might not want them for the entire day
	or you want an explanation for only one place
	or you want to know if there are intimate moments around the area 

there are a lot of stories in the places we know
- historical stories
- someone's special memory
people are more interested in the spot when they know the stories behind it


stickers in real time in AR
- pick a sticker, place them in real space, leave a voice message
- these stories are real world pins

where you leave a mark
when travellers enter an area (geofenced), they get a notification to explain what's happening, in AR.

the key is
	good content, constantly updated
	ar pins with orientation
